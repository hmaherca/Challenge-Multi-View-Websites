            Snarky Puppy is a group that tends to break genre stereotypes to make their own sound.
            Their name is quite deliberate in using the name 'Snarky' in that you think that you are
            listening to jazz, but then it may have elements of pop and rock mixed in. They really
            do have something for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group started in in Denton, Texas, in 2004 by Michael League. The group is made up of a 
            changing membership of about 40 musicians who perform on guitar, bass, keyboards, woodwinds, 
            brass, strings, drums, and percussion. Many band members were students at the University of 
            North Texas.

            Snarky Puppy released their debut album, The Only Constant, in 2006. Their first three albums

            Family Dinner â€“ Volume One, and We Like It Here to Ropeadope Records. In 2014, Snarky Puppy
            received their first Grammy for Best R&B Performance. They followed this up in 2016 and 2017
            with Grammies for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album.
